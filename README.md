## 📱🔁 🖥️ ♿ Responsive Layout & Accessibility

The app was tested to suit a wide spectrum of devices and with accessibility in mind.
<!-- <br>
Components incuding the modal and navigation bar are accessible to screen readers.
<br> -->
For a clean and usable design Bootstrap was implemented to the app. Thanks to this framework the layout of the library is set with optimal responsivity for a pleasant experience regardless of screen size.
